                <h3>The <u class = "first" ></u> And The <u class = "second" ></u></h3>

                <p>A <u ><b class="first"></b></u> was making fun of a <u><b class = "second"></b></u> one day<br>for being slow</p>

                <p><q>Do you ever get anywhere ?</q> He asked with a<br>mocking laugh.</p>

                <p><q><b><u class="ans"></u></b></q> replies the <b ><u class="second"></u></b> and I get <b><u class="speed"> </u></b> than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it.</p>

                <p> The <u ><b class="first"></b></u>  was much <u><b  class="adjective"></b></u>  of at the idea of <u ><b class="verb"></b></u> a race with the <u ><b class="second"></b></u> 
                    but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u ><b class="third"></b></u> who was consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled,<b><u class="quote"></u></b></p>

                <p>The <u ><b class="first"></b></u> was soon out of the sight and to make the <u ><b class="second"></b></u> feel very deeply how radiculios it was for him to try for race with a 
                    <u ><b class="first"></b></u>, he went of the course to practice
                <u><b class="verb"></b></u>  for  <u><b class="number"></b></u>  hours until the <u><b class="second"></b></u> should catch up</p>


                <p>The <u><b  class="second"></b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly and steadily and,after a time passed, the place where the <u ><b class="first"></b></u> was <u><b class="verb"></b></u>.
                     The <u ><b class="first"></b></u> was so caught up in <u><b class="verb"></b></u>
                    ,and when he last did stop, the <u ><b class="second"></b></u>  was near to goal. The now ran his swiftest,but he could not over the <u ><b class="second"></b></u> in time.</p>


                    <p>Moral of the story is:<b><u class = "moral"></u></b></p>
