                <h3>The <u > null</u> And The <u class = " a" >null</u></h3>

                <p>A <u ><b class="_"></b></u> was making fun of a <u><b class = "_">null</b></u> one day<br>for being slow</p>

                <p><q>Do you ever get anywhere ?</q> He asked with a<br>mocking laugh.</p>

                <p><q><b><u class="an">Yes</u></b></q> replies the <b ><u class="_">null</u></b> and I get <b><u class="speed"> </u></b> than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it.</p>

                <p> The <u ><b class=" _"></b></u>  was much <u><b  class="a"></b></u>  of at the idea of <u ><b class="v"></b></u> a race with the <u ><b class="__"></b></u> 
                    but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u ><b class=" __"></b></u> who was consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled,<b><u class="quote">example</u></b></p>

                <p>The <u ><b class=" _">null</b></u> was soon out of the sight and to make the <u ><b class=" "></b></u> feel very deeply how radiculios it was for him to try for race with a 
                    <u ><b class=" _">null</b></u>, he went of the course to practice
                <u><b class="v">null</b></u>  for  <u><b class="number"></b></u>  hours until the <u><b class=" a"></b></u> should catch up</p>


                <p>The <u><b  class=" a">null</b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly and steadily and,after a time passed, the place where the <u ><b class=" _"></b></u> was <u><b class="v"></b></u>.
                     The <u ><b class=" _">null</b></u> was so caught up in <u><b class="v"></b></u>
                    ,and when he last did stop, the <u ><b class=" a">null</b></u>  was near to goal. The now ran his swiftest,but he could not over the <u ><b class=" a"></b></u> in time.</p>


                    <p>Moral of the story is:<b><u class = "moral"></u></b></p>
